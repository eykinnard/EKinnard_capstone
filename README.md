## **Is Tornado and Dixie Alley Changing?**
*Capstone Project for Daytime Data Analytics Cohort #9 at Nashville Software School*
#### Is Tornado Alley shifting? Is Dixie Alley changing? With the increase in dangerous storms affecting the Tennessee area, it has been discussed by experts that the cause of this shift has been the impact of climate change with more moisture in the air coming from the gulf and drier air from the plains. I will be using data from various government agencies as well as reports and studies done by various universities.

## Motivation
<details>
    <summary>The increase of powerful storms</summary>
     Living in the middle Tennessee area and noticing the amount and strength of these storms increase, I am interested in exploring the data and comparing it to the other known areas for tornadoes. I am interested to see if there is evidence in the tornado alley and dixie alley areas changing locations.</details>

## Data Questions
#### 1.	Provide information on storms that have a high likelihood of producing tornadoes and seeing if there are any changes over the last 70 years.
#### 2.	Show statistical analysis on whether Tornado Alley and Dixie Alley areas are changing.
#### 3.	Provide density maps depicting any changes to the outbreak of tornadoes when water temperature changes in the Gulf of Mexico. The analysis will provide information if the rise in water temperature could be a factor with increased tornadoes.
#### 4.	Provide information on population and economic factors in Tornado Alley and Dixie Alley to discuss why it is important to designate these areas.

## Analytical Approach
<details>
    <summary> How were the data questions addressed?</summary>
    I will be analyzing data from NOAA to look at the changes in tornadoes from 1950 to 2021. I will be providing analysis not only on the number of tornadoes, but I will also be analyzing storm data to see if there is a change in weather patterns that would carry the most likelihood of producing tornadoes. I will also be analyzing population differences between tornado alley and dixie alley to explain the importance of designating those areas. I will be using various methods of obtaining data for this project. Webscraping and API will be used and the data will be analyzed using Python, SQL and Excel. The final presentation will be using Tableau and Google sites.</details>
